        I have more than 5 years of experience in the tourism industry, where I have worked as a Travel Agent, Tour Guide, and Tour Leader. My career has been driven by my passion for travel and the opportunity to showcase Romania to others, and to explore other parts of the planet.

        <p className="text-l">
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, I dabbled in learning HTML, CSS, and JS, but I could not give up on my main passion. However, in the meantime, the idea of learning front-end development began to sprout and finally blossomed at the end of 2023. Since then, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and after gaining a clear understanding of them, I started to focus on React and Tailwind CSS. Everything I've built so far has been reinterpreted from websites I've used previously and wasn't satisfied with their structure.

        <p className="text-l">
        My goal is to transition from a full-time Tour Guide and Tour Leader to a career as a Front-End Developer in the near future. My passion for tourism and travel still exists; I'm not denying it. However, I believe my priorities are shifting - I want to focus more on developing my career and travel a bit less.
